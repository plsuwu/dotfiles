probably able to just like paste the following into a terminal:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable xinput-xset.service
systemctl --user start xinput-xset.service
```

yet to actually test whether this persists through an initramfs rebuild from a pacman update but
should be reasonably simple to make a hook that will restart this service if not.
